# Extending Sails

There are currently three types of plugins in Sails:

+ **Generators** - for adding and overriding functionality in the Sails CLI
+ **Adapters** - for integrating Waterline (Sails' ORM) with new data sources, including databases, APIs, or even hardware.
+ **Hooks** - for overriding or injecting new low-level functionality in the Sails runtime
